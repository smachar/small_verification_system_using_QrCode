# small_verification_system_using_QrCode

This was a small project used during the organization of an event to watch the Clásico match (Barcelona vs Real Madrid).

this is a web application that gives the user the possibility to register for the event with his/her email, then he/she will receive an email with a QRCode image attached to it that he has to bring at the entry.

The app consists of two main pages, the first is used for the registration and the second for verification.

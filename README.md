# small_verification_system_using_QrCode

This was a small project used during the organization of an event to watch the Clásico match (Barcelona vs Real Madrid).

this is a web application that gives the user the possibility to register for the event with his/her email adress, and then he/she will receive a confirmation email including a qrCode image that he/she has to bring at the entry.

The app consists of two main pages, the first is used for the registration (qrdecode.html) and the second for verification (verifycode.php).
